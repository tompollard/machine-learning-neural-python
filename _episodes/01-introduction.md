## What are neural networks

The foundation of artificial neural network algorithms came about in the mid-1900s. was known as the "perceptron".

""The perceptron is a linear classifier, therefore it will never get to the state with all the input vectors classified correctly if the training set D is not linearly separable, i.e. if the positive examples cannot be separated from the negative examples by a hyperplane. In this case, no "approximate" solution will be gradually approached under the standard learning algorithm, but instead, learning will fail completely. Hence, if linear separability of the training set is not known a priori, one of the training variants below should be used.""

## What is an artificial neural network?

An artificial neural network, or just "neural network", is a broad term that describes a family of machine learning models that are (very!) loosely based on the neural circuits found in biology.

From a high level, a neural network is a system that takes input values, processes these values with a collection of functions, and then generates an output. Typically the system has parameters that can be systematically tweaked to allow pattern recognition.
